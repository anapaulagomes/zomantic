# zomantic

From Zotero to Semantic Scholar library

This project only exists because I really love Semantic Scholar paper recommendations
and Zotero is my go-to reference manager. I wanted to have the best of both worlds.

The tool is under development and I'm still figuring out how to make it work. ;)

## How to use

First, configure the environment variables from the `.env.example` file.
Then, run the following command:

```bash
zomantic --collection-name 'Review - pre-selection'
# or for all items
zomantic
```
